# Grape-Disease-Classification-using-CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify grape leaves as healthy or diseased (Black Rot, Esca, Leaf Blight). It features both a basic CNN model and a hyperparameter-tuned model.

## Overview

- **Basic CNN Model**: Achieves ~97.31% accuracy on test data.
- **Hyperparameter-Tuned CNN Model**: Achieves ~99.02% accuracy on test data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## Clone the Repository
```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grape-disease-classification.git
cd grape-leaf-disease-classification
## Dataset
Ensure your images are organized into dataset/train, dataset/validation, and dataset/test directories by class.

## Future Work
 - Expand dataset
 - Develop a mobile app
 - Implement transfer learning
